steps for using and running the nodejs
1)create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
mkdir sample-nodejs-project
cd sample-nodejs-project
2)Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command and following the prompts:
npm init
3)Install the necessary dependencies. In this case, we'll use Express, a popular Node.js web framework:
npm install express
4)Create a new file called index.js in your project directory. This file will contain your server code:
// Import the required modules
const express = require('express');

// Create an instance of the Express application
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route for the root URL
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
});
5)Save the file, and you're ready to run the server.

6)Start the server by running the following command in your project directory:
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed.
